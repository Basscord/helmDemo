# helmDemo


Presentation app from LA iOS Developer Meetup 3/29/17. Empty stubs awaiting connection to class that implements Multipeer Connectivity Framework. 

To connect to Zylon Defenders, download that repo and then add the MCController class to this app, and wire up the appropriate controls.  


### Notes on Multipeer Connectivity 
This uses Apple's [MutipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/reference/multipeerconnectivity) framework. The Multipeer Connectivity framework supports the discovery of services provided by nearby devices and supports communicating with those services through message-based data, streaming data, and resources (such as files). In iOS, the framework uses infrastructure Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth personal area networks for the underlying transport. In macOS and tvOS, it uses infrastructure Wi-Fi, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Ethernet. Each `MCSession` supports up to 8 peers, including the local peer.
